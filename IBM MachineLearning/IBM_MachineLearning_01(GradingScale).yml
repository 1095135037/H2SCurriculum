  set\r\n  of rules :\r\n\r\n  - Please remain courteous, polite, respectful and constructive
  at all \r\n    times during this exchange. \r\n\r\n  - Should you notice any malfunctions
  within the submitted project, \r\n    take a moment to discuss them and why it functioned
  that way. This will give you a better understanding of the topic.\r\n\r\n  - Keep
  in mind that some subjects can be interpreted differently.\r\n    If you come across
  a situation where the student you're grading \r\n    has interpreted the subject
  differently than you, try and judge\r\n    fairly whether their interpretation is
  acceptable or not, and grade\r\n    them accordingly. You will both learn the most
  by taking corrections seriously."
